go-password
===========

Simple Go package for working with cryptographically-secure password hashes.

Usage
-----

Create a new password manager:

    ```go
    import "github.com/vaughan0/go-password"
    manager := password.New()
    ```

Generate a hash from a password:

    ```go
    hash := manager.Hash("superdupersecret")
    ```

Check user input against the hash:

    ```go
    if manager.Check("password", hash) {
      fmt.Println("Wrong password")
    } else {
      fmt.Println("Correct! (ps. you need a better password)")
    }
    ```

Setting the hash algorithm
--------------------------

go-password supports the md5, sha256, sha1 and bcrypt hashing algorithms, and
by default uses bcrypt with a cost of 8.  To set which one the Manager should
use when hashing, simply change it's Default field:

    ```go
    manager.Default = "sha256"
    ```

Custom hash algorithms
----------------------

If you want to use a custom hash algorithm with go-password, you need to
implement the Algorithm interface:

    ```go
    type Algorithm interface {
      Hash(password []byte) []byte
      Check(password, hashed []byte) bool
    }
    ```

Then register your algorithm:

    ```go
    var algorithm password.Algorithm = new(MyAlgorithm)
    password.Register("myhash", algorithm)
    ```

Alternatively, if you just want to register a hash that already provides a
hash.Hash implementation (from the standard hash package), you may use the
RegisterHash function. This also adds random salts to your hashes:

    ```go
    var algorithm hash.Hash = myhashpackage.New()
    password.RegisterHash("myhash", algorithm)
    ```

Hash strings explained
----------------------

hash-name$encoded-binary-hash-data

The hash strings generated by go-password are made up of the hash algorithm's
name as it was registered (eg. "bcrypt" or "sha256"), followed by a dollar ($)
sign, followed by an encoded form of the algorithm-specific binary data. By
default the data is encoded with base64, but this can be changed by setting the
Manager.Codec field.
